This is a work in progress!  It is intented to provide a simple and easy C# interface
to BACnet on a Windows platform.  Right off the bat, you may notice that this code uses
DLL calls to the WinSock C library.  This is because the .NET (version 3.5) Socket class 
does not allow send and receive instances to be open to the same port at the same time. You
must Open a Send instance, close it, and then open a Receive instance to get the response. 
It works, but the results are unsatisfactory. (Maybe in newer versions of .NET this will 
be fixed?)  An alternative is to use WinSock, which provides a lower level access to UDP.  

Contents:
	WinSockWrap - The DLL (C++/C) code
		(Note - this is unmanaged code, you must copy the DLL to the same folder as the app)

	Source - the BACnet Stack code

	AppTest1 - A simple Windows program that reads Devices, Objects, 
		and can read/write Binary properties.

Updates:

November 19, 2013
	Original Issue

December 3, 2013
	Removed the ONE cyclic reference call (used for testing only)
	Removed unused code in AppTest1 (used for testing only)


To Do:
	Bacnet.Ccs: Replace Windows Timer with .NET Timer
	AppTest1: Add Analog Property Read/Write
